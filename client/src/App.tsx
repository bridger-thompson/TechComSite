            Using AI can be really simple and fun. You might already be using it
            when you talk to voice assistants on your parents' phone, play
            certain video games, or watch recommendations on a streaming
            service. Here are some tips to make AI tools work for you:
          </p>

          <div className="row">
            <div className="col-md-6">
              <h3 className="fs-3">Choosing the Right Tool</h3>
              <p>Identify your need to select an appropriate AI application.</p>
              <h4 className="text-muted">Blogging or Article Writing</h4>
              <p>
                Use AI writing assistants like ChatGPT to generate drafts,
                ideas, or even entire articles.
              </p>
              <h4 className="text-muted">Graphic Design</h4>
              <p>
                Tools like DALL-E can create unique images or artwork based on
                textual descriptions.
              </p>
              <h4 className="text-muted">Programming</h4>
              <p>
                Leverage AI tools like GitHub Copilot to assist with code
                suggestions, autocompletion, and documentation.
              </p>
              <h4 className="text-muted">Transcribing / Voiceover</h4>
              <p>
                Use AI tools like Whisper to transcribe audio, or Elevenlabs to
                generate voiceovers from text.
              </p>
            </div>

              <h3>Prompting Effectively</h3>
              <h4 className="text-muted">Be Specific</h4>
              <p>
                Instead of saying "write a story," try "write a story about a
                young detective solving a mystery in Paris in the 1920s."
              </p>
              <h4 className="text-muted">Provide Context</h4>
              <p>
                If you're seeking advice or information, give the AI enough
                background. For instance, "What are healthy dinner options for
                someone with a nut allergy?"
              </p>
              <h4 className="text-muted">Break Down Complex Requests</h4>
              <p>
                For complicated tasks, break them into smaller, manageable
                questions or steps. This approach can help the AI provide more
                precise and useful responses.
              </p>
              <h4 className="text-muted">Iterate Based on Responses</h4>
              <p>
                Use the AI's responses to refine your prompts. If the first
                answer isn't quite right, tweak your question based on the
                information provided and ask again.
