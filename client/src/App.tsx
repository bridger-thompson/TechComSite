              <h4 className="text-light">Blogging or Article Writing</h4>
              <p>
                Use AI writing assistants like ChatGPT to generate drafts,
                ideas, or even entire articles.
              </p>
              <h4 className="text-light">Graphic Design</h4>
              <p>
                Tools like DALL-E can create unique images or artwork based on

              </p>
              <h4 className="text-light">Programming</h4>
              <p>
                Leverage AI tools like GitHub Copilot to assist with code
                suggestions, autocompletion, and documentation.
              </p>
              <h4 className="text-light">Transcribing / Voiceover</h4>
              <p>
                Use AI tools like Whisper to transcribe audio, or Elevenlabs to
                generate voiceovers from text.

              <h3>Prompting Effectively</h3>
              <h4 className="text-light">Be Specific</h4>
              <p>
                Instead of saying "write a story," try "write a story about a
                young detective solving a mystery in Paris in the 1920s."
              </p>
              <h4 className="text-light">Provide Context</h4>
              <p>
                If you're seeking advice or information, give the AI enough
                background. For instance, "What are healthy dinner options for
                someone with a nut allergy?"
              </p>
              <h4 className="text-light">Break Down Complex Requests</h4>
              <p>
                For complicated tasks, break them into smaller, manageable
                questions or steps. This approach can help the AI provide more
                precise and useful responses.
              </p>
              <h4 className="text-light">Iterate Based on Responses</h4>
              <p>
                Use the AI's responses to refine your prompts. If the first
                answer isn't quite right, tweak your question based on the
                information provided and ask again.
